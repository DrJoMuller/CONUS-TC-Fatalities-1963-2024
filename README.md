# CONUS-TC-Fatalities-1963-2024
This database presents data published in Nature Natural Hazards "Continental United States direct Atlantic tropical cyclone fatalities: 1963–2024"

Methods

Following Rappaport (2000) we report on deaths occurring as a direct result of the forces of TCs or their remnants. Direct deaths include those individuals who drowned in storm surge, rough seas, rip currents, and freshwater floods. Direct deaths also include casualties resulting from lightning and wind-related events (e.g., flying debris, collapsing structures), with a subset of statistics kept for fatalities specifically due to tornadoes. Deaths incurring "indirectly," from such factors as heart attacks, housefires (e.g., from untended candles), electrocution from downed power lines, and vehicle accidents on wet roads, are not reported on in this paper. Because we are following Rappaport (2000) and Rappaport (2014) that focused on Atlantic TCs, we have not included fatalities from eastern North Pacific TCs. This may be included in a future study, but we suspect there may be challenges in collating fatalities from eastern North Pacific TCs (e.g. the change between the Redwood City National Weather Service Office to the National Hurricane Center between the 1987 and 1988 hurricane seasons, lack of Monthly Weather Review articles reviewing the 1963–1967 eastern North Pacific TC seasons as well as the general infrequency of eastern North Pacific TCs generating significant loss of life in the United States).
We follow closely Rappaport’s peril groupings (Rappaport 2014) with some slight changes. Like Rappaport (2014), we use the categories termed storm surge, freshwater flood (rain), surf (here we include rip current to align with Rappaport (2014)) offshore (rough seas/boating) and wind (including also tree fall) and tornado. Not all of the direct death incidents cited could be completely or unambiguously documented, especially for those in the earlier years of the database (e.g., 1960s). Therefore, a direct deaths “Unknown” category is also implemented. This is a new addition as previous studies did not note such a category, although Rappaport (2014) sometimes notes an “Other” category.

Data Sources
To obtain the data we used similar sources as reported in previous studies (Rappaport 2000) and Rappaport (2014) such as: 
1)	National Hurricane Center annual TC season summaries (NHC Annual, 2025), Tropical Cyclone and Storm Reports and National Hurricane Center Preliminary Reports (NHC Tropical, 2025)
2)	Tropical system summaries published in Monthly Weather Review (MWR, 2025; NOAA Library; 2025; NHC Annual, 2025)
3)	National Weather Service Natural Disaster Survey Reports
4)	National Weather Service Preliminary Post-Storm Reports from Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs),
5)	National Hurricane Center “Storm Wallets” (NHC Re-Analysis Project, 2025)
6)	US Army Corps of Engineers Reports
7)	Peer-reviewed publications and books on specific storms (e.g. Katrina, Camille, etc.). 
8)	Coroner and Medical Examiner Reports
9)	Newspapers

Methodological Process 
More specifically, as a starting point, we utilized the Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes dataset downloaded from the National Hurricane Center best track database (HURDAT2; Landsea and Franklin 2013) that includes storm name, year, landfall date, landfall location, landfalling wind and pressure and corresponding Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale category. We chose not to include unnamed storms (systems that were identified as named storms after the season) but verified that unnamed storms were not associated with CONUS fatalities. We also included fatalities from non-landfalling storms in our database if there were direct CONUS fatalities associated with that non-landfalling storm. To assess the causes of fatalities, we focus on 1963–2024 due to the more detailed reporting that is available. Between 1963–2024, there were 767 named TCs that we examined. While most direct fatalities were caused by storms that made CONUS landfall, several storms are also included that caused direct CONUS fatalities but did not officially make CONUS landfall.
Systematically every National Hurricane Center Tropical Cyclone Report and Monthly Weather Review (MWR) Report were reviewed for fatality information for each storm. For storms that noted cause of death, and/or location of death, the information was included in the database. This process was replicated for each storm from 1963 to 2024. From our research we found that starting in 1963, MWR began to break down fatalities by peril/cause of death (e.g., wind, surge, freshwater flood, etc.). For example, Beulah (1967) caused 10 deaths in Texas from floods and 5 deaths in Texas from tornadoes. However, other high fatality TCs in the 1960s did not report the deaths by peril. For example, in 1965, Betsy was responsible for 189 deaths, but the causes of these fatalities were not reported in the Monthly Weather Review article. For Betsy, we relied on a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report (USACE, 1965) that detailed 81 Louisiana fatalities, most likely from drowning, and the Encyclopedia of TCs, Typhoons, and Cyclones (Longshore, 1998) documenting marine deaths. Similarly, for Hurricane Inez (48 deaths) no breakdown was found in the MWR article, so in this case we utilize the National Hurricane Center storm wallets which indicated 45 deaths from rough seas. We found Blanchard’s “Deadliest American Disasters and Large Loss of Life Events website” (Blanchard, 2025) helpful in validating fatalities reporting for events with more than 10 fatalities. 
CONUS named storm and hurricane landfalls from 1963–1970 and 1983–2024 were tabulated from the Atlantic and Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory’s landfalling named storm (https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/uststorms.html) and landfalling hurricane tables (https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/UShurrs_detailed.html). For 1971–1982 when the National Hurricane Center’s Best Track Reanalysis is incomplete, we took the intensity of the TC at its six-hourly position prior to landfall as its landfall intensity. Only the strongest CONUS landfall was included for each storm.

Data Uncertainty
Several inherent challenges introduce uncertainty into TC fatality data analysis, which must be acknowledged when interpreting our findings. Large-scale catastrophic events often overwhelm local death investigation systems, resulting in incomplete or inconsistent documentation. Katrina (2005) exemplifies this challenge, where an initial official death toll of 1500 was reported in Monthly Weather Review: “The total number of fatalities directly related to the forces of Katrina is estimated to be about 1500 spread across four states, with about 1300 of these in Louisiana, about 200 in Mississippi, 6 in Florida, and one in Georgia. Especially for Louisiana and Mississippi, the number of direct fatalities is highly uncertain, and the true number will probably not ever be known. Several hundred persons are still reported missing in association with Katrina.” (Beven et al. 2008, p 1140).  An updated (4 January 2023) Hurricane Katrina National Hurricane Center TC report (Knabb et al., 2023) was later released with an estimated 520 direct fatalities following comprehensive epidemiological studies. Remote areas, resource-limited jurisdictions, and events causing widespread infrastructure damage present difficulties for systematic fatality documentation. TCs are often complex multi-hazard events that frequently produce simultaneous and overlapping hazards including storm surge, extreme winds, inland flooding, tornadoes, and secondary effects such as infrastructure failure. This temporal and spatial overlap makes definitive attribution of individual fatalities to a single cause challenging or, in some cases, impossible. For example, a fatality occurring during combined surge and wind events may be classified based on investigator judgment rather than conclusive physical evidence. This ambiguity is particularly pronounced in coastal zones where surge and wind hazards coincide. 

Methods for classifying and attributing TC-related fatalities have changed substantially over the study period. Earlier storms may have lacked systematic investigation protocols. The National Hurricane Center's definition of direct versus indirect fatalities, the time window considered for storm-related deaths, and the rigor of causal determination have all evolved. Additionally, changes in coroner/medical examiner practices, improvements in forensic capabilities, and shifting standards for what constitutes a "TC-related" death introduce temporal inconsistencies in the dataset that may confound trend analysis.
As we noted earlier, fatality data are compiled from multiple sources including the National Hurricane Center, Monthly Weather Review publications, individual state vital statistics, news reports, and academic studies. Discrepancies between these sources are common, and reconciliation often requires subjective judgment. We have attempted to use the most authoritative and recent compilations available, noting discrepancies where significant.
